# appendix-seq-comp-risk

This repository contains some supplementary material for the
manuscript entitled "Sequential trials in the context of competing
risks: concepts and case study, with R and SAS code".

Some R functions are provided. The script test.R has been used to test
these functions and to check that they can reproduce some results
provided elsewhere (mainly those from gsDesign and previous work of
Jennison and Turnbull).

The script Figures4and5.R reproduces Figures 4 and 5 of the
manuscript. These figures are the only ones which are not produced by
the .Rmd source code of the manuscript (and the corresponding R code).
